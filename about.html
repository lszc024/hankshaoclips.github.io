          </div>I am an undergraduate student majoring in Advertising.
          
          From a hesitant freshman studying statistics to a passionate filmmaker, 
          I’ve explored storytelling, cinematography, editing, and lighting design through real-world production experiences.
           My journey continues, fueled by curiosity, grit, and gratitude.
           
          </p>
      </div>
      
    
  
      <div class="about-section">
        
      <p>
        After graduating from high school in 2020, I didn’t have a clear direction for the future. 
        I chose to major in Applied Statistics at my current university, but during my freshman year, I found little interest in the coursework.
        
        
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time, I spent hours playing <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>, a racing game, on my computer. 
          While playing, I frequently came across videos made by gamers using the in-game "Photo Mode" to shoot cinematic footage of cars. 
          The game’s realistic graphics and their refined editing made these short clips look nearly indistinguishable from real-life footage.
      </p>
      
      <div style="position: relative;">
        <div class="float-box" style="float:right; top:9px; left:20px;">
          <img src="images/about/first-edit.jpg" class="about-img" style="width:240px;">
          <div class="caption">My first editing work</div>
        </div>
      <p>
        I was deeply intrigued. 
        I began experimenting with different angles and camera movements in the game’s photo mode and tried capturing dynamic shots.
        Later, I started learning basic video editing software online and used it to cut together the in-game footage into complete videos. 
        One of these videos even became my final project for a course called Mastering Social Media, and to my surprise, I earned a perfect score of 100.
         For the first time in college, I felt a sense of confidence in something I had created.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        As I reflected on that experience, I realized how focused and fulfilled I felt while framing shots and crafting visuals.
          Despite the time and effort involved, I thoroughly enjoyed the process. 
         That’s when I knew I needed to pursue a field that I was truly passionate about.
        </p>

<p>
  I started looking into the possibility of changing majors.
   I explored all the available programs and eventually came across Advertising, which included TV commercials, video ads, and short films. 
   I knew it was the right direction. 
   I brought this idea to my family, but they were skeptical and advised me to stick with a more “secure” or “employable” path.
    I remained firm. I showed them the videos I had made and explained how much I loved this work. 
    They saw my determination and chose to support me.
     At the end of my first year, I successfully transferred into the Advertising program.
</p>


<div style="position: relative;">
<div class="float-box" style="float:left; top:10px; left:0px;">

  <div class="caption">My first microfilm still frame</div>
</div>
<p>
  As the new semester began, 
  I was eager to join the filmmaking world. 
 I decided to participate in the National College Advertising Art Competition and chose to shoot a microfilm-style advertisement. 
 At that point, I had no real knowledge of how to operate a camera. 
 I wrote a simple script with some classmates, and we rented a guesthouse to use as a shooting location.
 I had no idea what aperture, shutter speed, or ISO meant—I just knew how to hit the record button. 
 A friend helped me adjust the exposure settings, and I directed the actors while trying to find the right angles.  
That was the first time I truly played the role of both director and cinematographer. 
It was exhausting, but we completed the shoot.
</p>
 </div> 
      <p>
        Later, in the editing process, I began to understand how fragmented footage could be shaped into a coherent story using Premiere Pro.
         Watching my own shots on the timeline, I realized that my framing and composition had a unique style—different from what I had seen before.
      </p>

            <div class="caption">Learning to use camera</div>
          </div>
      <p>
          Though the film was amateurish, it caught the attention of a professor from the Media Department.
         I expressed my interest in film to him, and he encouraged me to join their studio, YingJiang Studio.
          I seized the opportunity, passed the interview, and became a member of the team.
           At the studio, I gained access to professional filmmaking equipment for the first time.
           As a newcomer, I wasn’t allowed to operate the gear at first, so I watched intently as senior members handled the cameras and lighting setups. 
        They introduced us to fundamental concepts: how to expose video correctly on a Sony mirrorless camera, how to choose the right shots for narrative, 
        and how to differentiate between various framing techniques.
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        As time went on, I gradually got the chance to shoot simple videos. 
        The studio had a competitive system—each week, my teammate and I had to produce a short video. 
        Only the best one would be published on our university’s official social media. 
        I invested all my effort into every aspect: from conceptualizing ideas to operating the camera, editing footage, and experimenting with techniques. 
        My skills started to improve rapidly, and I genuinely enjoyed the process.
      </p> 
      
      <div style="position: relative;">
      <div class="float-box" style="float:left; top:10px; left:0px;">
            <img src="images/about/be-camera-man.jpg" class="about-img" style="width:140px;">
            <div class="caption">Being camera man</div>
          </div>
      <p>
        My progress was noticed by a senior, 
        who began assigning me leadership roles in small projects.
        That’s when I started learning the importance of teamwork—communicating with crew members, coordinating with actors, and managing logistics. 
        The bigger the project, the more responsibility I carried. 
        I often felt anxious the night before a shoot, afraid of failing to meet expectations, but I pushed through every time.
      </p>
      </div>


      <p>
        In the summer of 2023, my senior graduated and left the studio. I suddenly found myself in charge. 
        I wanted to raise the standard of our productions.
        I realized that despite using similar cameras, our videos lacked the polish of professional work. 
        That’s when I discovered the importance of lighting. 
      </p>

      <p> 
      Good lighting transforms everything—but I had no idea how to set it up. So that summer, I attended a week-long intensive course on Cinematography and Lighting. 
        For the first time, I saw an ARRI cinema camera up close, and I learned about large-scale film equipment like dolly tracks, jibs, and follow-focus systems. 
      </p>

      <div style="position: relative;">
      <div class="float-box" style="float:right; top:0px; left:20px;">
          <img src="images/about/on-the-class.jpg" class="about-img" style="width:270px;">
          <div class="caption">I was on the course</div>
        </div>
      <p> 
        In one of the first lessons, the instructor demonstrated a basic lighting setup for a portrait. 
        It took several lights and modifiers just to shoot a single person’s upper body. 
        I was amazed. Later, we participated in a mock commercial shoot, using professional art direction, lighting design, camera setups, and actor blocking. 
        That experience opened my eyes to the professional workflow of high-level productions.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        After the course, I returned to campus and was immediately tasked with shooting the university’s 2023 admissions video—a major project and an important opportunity. 
        I researched many promotional films from prestigious universities and decided to experiment with real lighting for the first time. 
        Though the setup was simple, it introduced a noticeable improvement in visual quality. 
        My teachers and teammates appreciated the results, and I felt encouraged to keep pushing forward.
       </p>

          <div class="caption">Being director</div>
        </div>
      <p>
        Over the next few months, 
        I continued experimenting with different genres and styles, while participating in various filmmaking competitions. 
        Every project offered me new lessons and inspiration. 
        By the summer of 2024, I was busier than ever. 
        My team and I began preparing for the 16th National Advertising Art Competition for College Students. 
        The film we submitted was a fast-paced sports short—a genre I had never tackled before. 
        I studied existing ads from brands like Nike and Adidas and tried to emulate their dynamic visuals. 
        Although it was exhausting, I learned so much. 
        After more than a month of intense production, we completed the film and won the National Second Prize.
      </p>
      </div>
  
  
  
      
      <p>
        Later that year, I interned on a few student film crews.
        Although I was the same age as most of the crew, they came from specialized film academies and had significantly more experience. 
        I found myself watching from the sidelines, doing basic tasks without much responsibility. 
        That contrast helped me understand just how far I still had to go—in terms of professional workflow, artistic aesthetics, and equipment handling.
      </p>

      <div class="float-box" style="float:right; top:-2px; left:20px;">

          <div class="caption">From the corner set</div>
        </div>
      <p>
        In the fall of 2024, I directed my first large-scale short film, From the Corner, a basketball-themed narrative. 
        It was a demanding project involving numerous actors and complicated scenes. I spent nearly four months working from concept to final cut. 
        I encountered countless challenges and faced intense pressure, but I persisted. 
        While the final film wasn’t perfect, it demonstrated how far I’d come and was ultimately awarded “Outstanding Graduation Work” by my department.
      </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        From a struggling, uncertain freshman to someone who found passion and earned recognition—this five-year journey was filled with both setbacks and growth. 
        But I know this is only the beginning. 
        There’s still so much for me to learn and experience, and I’m excited for what lies ahead.
      </p>
        <p>Lastly, I want to thank my Sony A7M4, my MacBook Pro, and most of all—my mother. They’ve supported me through every step of this incredible journey. 
          Additionally, i must thank my friends, they helped me a lot during my filmmaking journey.
